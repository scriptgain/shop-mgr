 * time a shopper reaches here, so this controller only ever moves an existing
 * order between payment states. It never creates one, never prices one, and
 * never accepts an amount.
 *
 * Both pages are reached by a signed URL. That is what lets a guest with no
 * account get back to their own payment page after a 3D Secure bounce, while
 * making the URL useless to anyone who did not receive it: the order number is
 * in the path, so without a signature it would be trivially walkable.

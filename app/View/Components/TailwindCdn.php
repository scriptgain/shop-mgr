 *      browser build does not use. Read from the file rather than pasted here
 *      so @theme/@apply never appear in Blade source, where Blade would try to
 *      read them as directives.
 *   2. The legacy config('brand.accent') ramp, for installs that set an accent
 *      before the Theme Manager existed and have no theme rows yet.
 *   3. The active theme's tokens. Last, so a theme always wins.
 *
 * The work lives in this class, not in the template, because the template's job
 * is markup (house rule: no PHP logic in views).
